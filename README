== Apify

Apify is a Rails project where I'm developing a generator, which would generate just:

- standard model, based on what your orm is
- controller which details restful CRUD for the model and responds only json
- routes for the restful crud

The main idea is with on generator generate everything you need for API and nothing more (like scaffold-generator would do) to ease the development of applications with heavy client-side infrastructure.
